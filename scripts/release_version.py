"""Decide the version the next release ships under, given git-cliff's proposal.

The scheduled release asks `git-cliff --bumped-version` for a tag. git-cliff's default sends a breaking
change to the next major, which is right for a package that has promised an API and wrong for one that
has not: at `v0.16.1`, a single `feat!:`/`fix!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` commit makes its answer `v1.0.0` --
measured against this repository's tag history, not predicted. That would publish a stable-API claim as
a side effect of an ordinary change, and a published version cannot be withdrawn.

The rule this applies:

    while the current version is `0.x.y`, a proposed major bump is demoted to a minor bump, unless the
    release was run with `allow_major_bump`; once the current major is `>= 1`, git-cliff's answer stands
    untouched.

`cliff.toml` cannot express that. `[bump] breaking_always_bump_major = false` would also disable the
enforced major bump at `>= 1`, which is the half worth keeping -- so the decision is post-processing on
git-cliff's answer rather than configuration of it.

Run as a script it takes the two versions and prints the answer, which is what the workflow uses:

    python scripts/release_version.py --current v0.16.1 --proposed "$(git-cliff --bumped-version)"

It lives in `scripts/` rather than in `src/`: it is release tooling and has no business in the wheel.
`pyproject.toml` puts `scripts` on the test path so it is covered like anything else, because a wrong
answer here is both expensive and silent -- a version cannot be unpublished, and nothing downstream
would flag `1.0.0` as unintended.
