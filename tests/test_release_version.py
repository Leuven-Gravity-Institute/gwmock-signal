"""Which version the next release ships under.

The scheduled release asks `git-cliff --bumped-version` for the tag, and git-cliff's default takes a
breaking change straight to the next major. At `v0.16.1`, with one breaking commit in the history since
that tag, its answer is `v1.0.0` -- measured against this repository's tags, not predicted -- and `v1.x`
declares a stable API this package is not ready to promise.

So the rule, and what these tests pin:

    while the current version is 0.x.y, a breaking change bumps the *minor*, not the major, unless the
    release is run with `allow_major_bump` -- and once the current major is >= 1, git-cliff's answer
    stands untouched.

This is decided in a module rather than in workflow shell because a wrong answer here is expensive and
silent: a version cannot be unpublished, and nothing downstream would flag `1.0.0` as unintended.
